# RegularExpressions_EBB

This is a school project consisting of 3 parts all related to regular expressions. 
Part 1 searches the Dracula text for certain patterns. 
Part 2 extracts text from a PDF and writes it to a text file. And then uses regex to search through the file and write the output to another text file.
Part 3 searches through log files for user names and IP addresses.
